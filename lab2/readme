Input/Ouput redirection
	Output redirection
		- Instead of displaying information on the display, output redirection allows commands to write to file.
	Input redirection
		- Instead of typing in arguments for a command, a file can be used instead to input the commands


	<command> <arg>? > <file>
		- Instead of displaying the output on the display, the '>' symbol writes the output of the given command to the file <file>.
		- This overwrite the entire file. 

		This only works on the following commands:
			- dir
			- environ
			- echo
			- help

	<command> <arg>? >> <file>
		- Instead of displaying the output on the display, the '>' symbol writes the output of the given command to the file <file>.
