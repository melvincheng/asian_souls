a. first fit will be used to allocate memory because its intuitive, realistic, practical, and simple to implement

b. a linked list will be used to by the dispatcher for both memory allocation and queueing

c. one function to read the textfile containing processes
one function to dispatch
one function to keep track of the programs, and change the priorities of the programs, and terminate the programs
PROTOTYPES
void file_read()
void dispatch(pid_t pid)
void track(pid_t pid)

d. A multilevel dispatching scheme is used because certain programs are more crucial than other programs, therefore, priority queue are necessary.
SHORTCOMING
Overhead
Possibility of starvation
IMPROVEMENTS
Time slice - each queue gets an amount of CPU time
Moving processes up and down different queue
